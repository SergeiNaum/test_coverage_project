### Discription:
           A project to help with the task of covering code with tests
           on the Python profession - developer of the educational platform Hexlet.io.
           The project contains 3 modules:
                                   1) common_conditions - placed test data and "conditions"
                                   2) common_functions - placed correct and incorrect function implementations
                                                                (right and wrong_N)
                                   3) main - runs all functions with all test data

With the help of this project, by manipulating with the test cases filling, it is possible to display for visual analysis the results
of correct and wrong function implementations to further write tests in which the function with the right
realization should pass the test, while the other functions will not.
